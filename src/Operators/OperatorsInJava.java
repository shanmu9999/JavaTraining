	//5 Types of Operators in Java
	
	//1. Arithmetic Operators ==> Special characters used in mathematical operations (+,-,*,/,% (modulus),++(increment-increase by 1),--(decrement - decrease by 1))
	//2. Assignment operators==> used to assign values to variables (=,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=)
	//3. Comparison Operators==> used to compare two values and return a boolean result (==,!=,>,<,>=,<=)
	//4. Logical Operators==> used to combine multiple conditions and build the logic (&& (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT))
	//5. Ternary Operator ==> used to evaluate a condition and return one of two values based on the result (condition ? value1 : value2)
